# House Roast
The House Roast is a device that will convert your GE convection oven into a coffee roasting machine! Develop custom roast profiles, share profiles with others coffee lovers, and control the whole thing right from your phone. This will redefine micro-roasting!

## How it works
* Connect the House Roast controller to your GE convection oven (it connects via the [green bean](http://market.firstbuild.com/products/greenbean)
* Download and install the House Roast app (coming soon)
* Pair your phone/app with the House Roast controller
* Tweak the default roast profile to your liking (or start from scratch!)
* Place green coffee beans in a single layer on the roasting tray
* Lay the temperature sensor on top of the beans
* Start the roast and allow the oven to preheat
* Place the tray in the oven and begin roasting
* When the roast is complete, remove the tray and allow the beans to cool
* Once cool, remove the chaff using the chaff removal box
* Grind, brew and enjoy!

## Roast profiles
Roast profiles are broken up into 3 general phases:
* Pre-heat phase - Bring the oven up to the desired starting temperature to quickly dry out the beans at the start of the roast.
* First-Crack phase - Continue drying out the beans and raise the temperature at the desired rate.  Ideally, beans will begin cracking at the end of this phase.
* Finish Phase - Finish the beans for optimal flavor.  This phase typically increases temperature at a slower rate than the previous phase and will normally stop before reaching "Second Crack".
